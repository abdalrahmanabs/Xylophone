# Xylophone App

The Xylophone app is a simple Flutter app that lets you play different sounds by tapping on colored buttons. Each button corresponds to a different note, and the app plays a sound when the button is tapped. The app is designed to simulate a xylophone, a percussion instrument that produces musical tones by striking wooden bars with mallets.

## Features

- Seven colored buttons that correspond to different notes
- Each button plays a different sound when tapped
- The app has a dark background to create a contrast with the colored buttons
- The app uses the `audioplayers` package to play the sounds

## Usage

To play a sound, simply tap on one of the colored buttons on the screen. Each button corresponds to a different note, and the app plays a sound when the button is tapped. You can tap on multiple buttons to create a melody or a rhythm.
